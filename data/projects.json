Texas instrument\u2019s ADS7843 serves as a touch screen controller which converts analog signals from touch screen to digital signal that later is provided as an input to the FPGA. Programming of the FPGA is done in Verilog HDL language. The board is provided with an independent programming platform Quartus II. The serial communication is established between the FPGA and the ADC using SPI serial bus interface.",

They can either fly remotely (a ground pilot controls the UAV directly using some kind of remote control) as well as autonomously (a flight path is introduced into the UAV and it just follows it). In recent years, the level of interest in the development of fixed-wing UAVs for various missions has risen significantly. A crucial issue concerning these aircraft is their high power consumption compared to their limited energy storage capability.",

Usually Image Processing system includes treating images as two dimensional signals while applying already set signal processing methods to them. It is among rapidly growing technologies today, with its applications in various aspects of a business. Image Processing forms core research area within engineering and computer science disciplines too. Image processing basically includes the following three steps.\r\nImporting the image with optical scanner or by digital photography.\r\nAnalysing and manipulating the image which includes data compression and image enhancement and spotting patterns that are not to human eyes like satellite photographs.\r\nOutput is the last stage in which result can be altered image or report that is based on image analysis.",

The competition demanded to solve a maze with walls and reach the goal in minimum time. The team built a small bot which was manufactured using Laser cutting with acrylic as the base material. The chassis had a front castor wheel with two rear motor-powered wheels so that it can turn about itself with a small turning radius if required. A 9v LIPO battery was attached for onboard power supply. Equipped with 3 ultrasonic sensors and Arduino UNO as brains, this bot was able to detect surrounding walls and remain in the middle of the lane and avoid any collision. Most important part of the framework design was to keep the ultrasonic sensors concrete in cases of collision as well as when the bot moved. Interconnecting and precise fit parts were used for this purpose. Left-first and backtracking algorithms were used to explore and solve the maze. PID was used to tune the turns and lane centring of the bot. This bot was built in a span of 1-week by a team of 4 freshmen.",
